      "The Reverend (Henry) Francis Lyte was vicar of Lower Brixham of Devonshire, a small fishing town on the southwest tip of the English isle. Lyte ministered at All Saint's Church, the tower of which still stands over the town, starting around 1824, about 9 years after the church was built. His ministry lasted 23 more years. \n",
      " \n",
      "By the time he was 54, Lyte's health had  deteriorated due to tuberculosis, what at the time was a painful and incurable illness. He gave what would turn out to be his last sermon on September 4, 1847. He'd made plans to travel to the warmth of Italy for a therapeutic trip, but at the time he was so weak that chances are he knew he might not make it that far. \n",
      " \n",
      "That same afternoon, he prayerfully walked along the beautiful coastline. He retired to his room a dusk. An hour later, he had written the lyrics to \"Abide with Me\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Lyte embarked on his trip. Stopping in France, he revised the lyrics he'd written in Brixham and mailed them to his wife. He travelled on to Nice where on November 20, 1847, his lungs gave out and he passed away. Another English minister, Reverend Manning of Chichester, was at the same hotel and attended to Lyte during his last moments. Lyte's last words were \"Peace! Joy!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "News of Lyte's death arrived at Brixham soon after the revised lyrics of Abide with Me. As the request of the fishermen whom he ministered to, the hymn was sung for the first time at Lyte's memorial service. \n",

      "John Newton was a troubled kid who turned into a troubled young adult. His mother had died of tuberculosis when he was only six. His father worked on a boat and was never around, so he was raised by a stepmother who was distant to him and spent time in a boarding school where he was mistreated. At age 11, Newton joined his father as an apprentice on a ship. \n",
      " \n",
      "As he grew into adulthood, he became an insolent, headstrong man, ultimately renouncing the little faith that had been instilled in him by his mother. He joined the Royal Navy, only to desert, be captured, and be publicly flogged and demoted. After this he joined a slave ship and ended up continuing behavior that resulted in he himself being imprisoned, enslaved and forced to work on plantations like the slaves he was carrying. He was ultimately rescued by a sea captain who had known his father. \n",
      " \n",
      "Aboard his new ship, the Greyhound, Newton continued his ways, described by the captain of the ship as one of the most profane men he had ever met. But one day in March 1748 in the North Atlantic, the ship encountered a horrific storm. Newton witnessed one of his fellow crew members swept overboard by the waves to his death--from a place where Newton himself was standing just moments earlier. As water poured onto the ship, the crew began a desperate effort to empty water to keep the ship from capsizing. After hours of a losing battle of bailing water, with their captain's agreement, Newton and a shipmate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being swept overboard and continued to work for several more hours. At the point of his greatest desperation, he cried out, \"Lord, have mercy on us.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Two weeks later, the battered ship and what was left of the crew landed in Ireland. Weeks prior to the trip, Newton had been reading \"The Christian's Pattern\", sort of a Cliff's Note's version of The Imitation of Christ. He though back to the phrase he had cried out on the ship, and then thought about how he had not only renounced his faith, but also openly opposed it, mocked others of faith, and denounced God as a myth. \n",
      " \n",
      "On May 10, 1748, Newton accepted faith in Christ. Unlike some of the stories about his, he didn't give up the slave trade right away, but he did see to it that slaves under his care were treated humanely. He continued sailing for seven more years, during which time he educated himself. After he gave up sailing in 1755, he came to know religious leaders of the day such as George Whitefield and John Wesley. Newton eventually became an ordained minister. \n",
      " \n",
      "In 1767 the poet William Cowper settled in Newton's town of Olney, where the two became good friends. They held weekly church services and weekly prayer meetings, and composed hymns to be used during the weekly service, which eventually were compiled and published in an early hymnal called \"Olney Hymns\" in 1779, which contained 68 pieces by Cowper and 280 by Newton. \n",
      " \n",
      "The music that we associate with Amazing Grace actually wasn't added to the hymn until 1835, when William Walker tied the words to a traditional song called \"New Britain\". The pairing stuck and the hymn went on to become one of the most famous and well-loved in history. \n",
      " \n",
      "How is it that a profligate and profane young man who was only destined for misery, suffering, and sure death could have turn into a powerful minister for God who lived a long and contented life, who died with the hope of heaven in his heart, and who wrote such powerful words that still carry power today? It all comes down to two words: Amazing Grace. And if that Grace can touch a man like that, how much more can it transform your life. All you need to do is accept it. \n",

      "When Charles Wesley and his older brother John were studying in Oxford, they formed a group called the \"Holy Club\" which met weekly and made it their aim to put their faith into action and systematically live holy lives, setting aside time for prayer, examining their spiritual lives, and studying the Bible. Because their approach was extremely methodical, their classmates mocked them. They began to be known as \"Methodists\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Well, you can probably guess the rest of the story. John Wesley went on to be the founder of Methodism, initially meant to be a reform movement within the Anglican church (The Church of England), but eventually becoming a separate denomination of its own after John Wesley's death in 1791. Among the adherents and early leaders of Methodism was George Whitefield, who went on to become the best known preacher in the 18th century and a huge spiritual influence to early America, including many founding fathers.\n",
      " \n",
      "Charles Wesley provided the hymnody for this growing movement, writing over 6500 hymns through his lifetime, many of which we still sing today, including Christ the Lord Is Risen Today; Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Love Divine, all Loves Excelling; Jesus, Lover of My Soul; O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing; and many more. His hymns reflect the tenets of his and his brother's ministry, which was to shun apathetic, lifeless worship of God that had pervaded the church, and to help faith come alive. In his lyrics, you can see emphasis on  salvation and a personal Christian experience, and the emotion of some of his lyrics were unprecedented for his times. \n",

      "\n",
      "          “John Brown’s body lies a-smoulderin’ in the grave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "          Sound familiar? No? How about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "          “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord”.\n",
      "\n",
      "          Ah yes, that’s better. It’s “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”. No doubt you’ve memorized the first stanza of the hymn. If not, at least you know the Refrain.\n",
      "\n",
      "          “Glory, Glory Hallelujah! His truth is marching on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "          This hymn had a very long and storied history. While earlydetails are sketchy, the tune probably started around 1858 as a Methodist hymn called \"Brothers, will you meeet us\". During the Civil War in 1861, members of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia added the words \"John Brown's Body Lies a-Smoldering in the Grave\". While most people assume that the John Brown here was the famous Abolitionist, writer Irwin Silber says that the lyrics were instead an inside joke referring to Sargeant John Brown, a second tenor in the battalion glee club. \n",
      " \n",
      "Identity of John Brown notwithstanding, this version of the song gained popularity during the Civil War as a popular little ditty. Julia Ward Howe happened to visit a Union Army camp one day, and heard the song. The next day, in the early morning before dawn, she woke up and scrawled the verses to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. It’s a good thing she found the stump of a pen she was using before, or this tune and the poem in her mind would have been lost to obscurity.\n",
      "\n",
      "          The poem she wrote, of course, was inspired by the word of God. The second line, “He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored” seems to be inspired by Revelation 14:19…”The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath”. The third line is from Ezekiel 21:9. “A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished—sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning”. In the third stanza, which not many people know, she writes, “Let the Hero, born of women, crush the serpent with His heel”, from Genesis 3:15.\n",
      "\n",
      "          The hymn has become one of the most beloved hymns in history. You can hardly sing it without feeling excited about the coming day of Christ, without feeling the fear of God’s righteous judgement, without feeling the need to get yourself ready for the train a-coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "          And to think that it started as a little war camp ditty.\n",
      "\n",
      "          When my mom was still on the earth, she had a gift for counseling. To her last days, people would literally come to her for counsel and wisdom. Even as she lay in the hospital with cancer, a steady stream of people came to her hospital room. They came to visit her, but by the end of their visit, they were telling her about their problems and asking for advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "          I once asked her what her ‘approach’ was to pastoral work. I’ll never forget her answer. She said that too many people think you need to be versed in psychology, or to learn counseling techniques. Mom didn’t learn any of that—in fact, she was a biochemist. What did she do when people came to her for advice? All she did was to sit with them, let them talk, and then share some scripture verses with them. She always seemed to have just the right verse for the occasion. Then, she would put them into prayer. Mom once told me that endless talk is worthless--because man can do nothing...only God can melt the human heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "          What’s the message here? Only this. The word of God is “living and active. Sharper than any two-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "          Just as the word of God transformed this song from a campfire ditty to one of the most powerful and beloved hymns in history, it can transform your life. If the Word of God is a part of you, your mundane, workaday job becomes a blessing, even a ministry to the co-workers around you. Casual, ordinary conversations with friends become blessings to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "        If we leave the Bible on the shelf to collect more dust, that's exactly what we'll get out of it. But if we read the Bible because we know that its words can transform our lives and help us be a blessing to those around us, that’s exactly what will happen too.\n",

      "The words of this hymn actually date back to 6th century Ireland. Originally it was not set to music at all, but was a monastic prayer called Rop tú mo baile, attributed to Dallan Forgaill. It wasn't until 1905 that Mary E. Byrne translated the lyrics from ancient Irish to English. The words were put in lyric form by Eleanor Hull in 1912. The hymn eventually was paired with the traditional Irish folk tune Slane in a 1927 hymnal. \n",

      "Sadly, we live in a generation today that seems all too willing to push God away. Technology has become a modern-day Tower of Babel. Who needs God when we have medical technology that can fix all kinds of diseases? Who needs God when there are so many ways to fill our lives, from reality TV shows, to social networks, to shopping, to going out drinking and having fun? \n",
      " \n",
      "But of course, these things just fill your life temporarily, leaving an even emptier hole afterwards. But this hymn is a good reminder of what a full life really is. Fulfillment doesn't come from becoming rich or famous. It only comes from understanding that a full life comes from remaining in Christ, because with him, you can bear all kinds of fruit, and apart from Him, you can do nothing. \n",

      "Many of you may be familiar with the Gaither Homecoming Series, a series of videos, recordings, and concerts held by Bill and Gloria Gaither. As someone who is a big fan of Christian hymns, praise songs, and gospel music it thrilled me when these videos were released, and I wanted to get every one. There was just a simple joy in watching the videos, sort of a throwback to the old revival meetings and \"All Night Sings\" from a simpler time. Some of the earlier videos from the 1990s feature great singers of the past like Jake Hess and Vestal Goodman whose voices are gone now, but whose voices have been preserved for posterity. The Gaithers are still very much active today in music ministry; if you're lucky enough to live in an area where they hold concerts, the Gaither's Web site  has a listing of upcoming concerts and homecoming events. \n",
      " \n",
      "Because He Lives was written by Bill and Gloria Gaither in 1969 around the time their son was born (coincidentally, this was the same year I was born). While our world seems chaotic today, remember that chaos is nothing new; in the late 1969's the country was being torn apart by racial tensions and war. And rather than turning back to God, it seemed the country was abandoning God in a big way. These were the times when the sexual revolution, the rampant drug culture, and increasing immorality in media started. \n",
      " \n",
      "At the same time, the Gaithers were facing struggles of their own, physically and emotionally. They asked the terrifying question that all parents ask: what kind of world am I bringing my child into? What will this world be when my child grows up? What things will this child face? \n",
      " \n",
      "Their son, Benjamin, was born safe and sound. As happens with most parents, they held their infant in their arms and felt the love flow out from them which conquered all fears. And as much love as they had toward the baby they held in their arms, they were reminded of how much greater love that God has toward us, and that just as we want to do everything to protect, love, and keep our children, so does our heavenly Father feel the same towards us. Out of this came the words to this hymn. \n",
      " \n",
      "Gloria Gaither told Robert Morgan, the author of the hymn stories book \"Then Sings My Soul\" (see the Resources links to the right) the following: \"Over the years this song has reassured us that our Lord's resurrection is the central truth of life. Because He lives, we can face tomorrow. Many time since, as our children grew, our business life changed, our fortunes shifted, or our direction clouded, our family has found assurance in this very personal song. It's 'our song', but we're grateful othes have loved it too.'\". \n",

      "One of my favorite quotes comes from Helen Keller, the blind, deaf, and mute author, activist for the disabled, and lecturer. The story goes that once someone asked her, \"Isn't it terrible to be blind?\" to wihch she responded, \"Better to be blind and see with your heart than to have two good eyes and see nothing.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "One woman who \"saw\" was a woman who was born about 50 years before her named Fanny Crosby. You probably recognize her name from your hymnal. She was the lyricist responsible for songs like All the Way My Savior Leads Me, Close to Thee, He Hideth My Soul, Draw Me Nearer, Jesus Is Calling, Near the Cross, Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior, Safe in the Arms of Jesus, Saved by Grace, To God Be the Glory, and over 8,000 others. \n",

      "When she was only six weeks old, a doctor applied medicine to her eyes that destroyed her sight forever. While this may have destroyed other lives, Crosby maintained a cheerful optimism, while also developing a skill for poetry even at an early age. At age 8 she wrote:\n",
      " \n",
      "O what a happy soul and I,\n",
      "Although I cannot see,\n",
      "I am resolved that in this world\n",

      "At age 15, she entered the Institution for the Blind in New York where she continued to be a remarkable writer. It wasn't until age 41 when she met the famous composer William Bradbury that she started writing hymns. There is where she finally knew she'd found her calling in life, generating about three hymns a week for the rest of her life. She wrote that she was the \"happiest creature in all the land.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "As contemporaries often do to great artists, her work wasn't necessarily respected at the time. An English hymnologist John Julian once remarked that her hymns were \"with very few exceptions, very weak and poor\". All I can say to Mr. Julian is, 200 years later more people remember Fanny Crosby than remember John Julian. :) \n",

      "Blessed Assurance was a hymn where the tune preceded the lyrics. While visiting with her dear friend Phoebe Knapp, a musician who was a fellow resident of New York City and fellow member of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church, Knapp played the melody two or three times for Crosby and asked what she felt the tune said. Crosby answered in an instant: \"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\" \n",

      "Fanny Crosby passed on in 1915. At her request, a small gravestone was put there with the words \"Aunt Fanny: she hath done what she could; Fanny J. Crosby\". Forty years later, depsite her instructions, her friends put up a large memorial stone that contained the first stanze of Blessed Assurance. \n",

      "Even though he lived over 100 years ago, many of the hymns of William Kirkpatrick are still favorites today and will probably still be favorites 100 years from now. Hymns like He Hideth My Soul, Jesus Saves, and Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus are just a few of the amazing hymns that are not just beautiful, but also chock full of the power of God's word. \n",
      " \n",
      "But even though hymn writing in his day was a popular endeavor and in many cases a profitable one, William Kirkpatrick never lost sight of the purpose of the hymns he was writing. While leading a camp meeting one day, he listened to the soloist that was hired to sing for the event. While the soloist had a beautiful voice and could sing with great expression and feeling, Kirkpatrick was saddened that as soon as the soloist was finished with his assigned songs, he would leave without staying to hear to the preacher's message. Kirkpatrick feared that the young man didn't know Christ, and began to earnestly for the soloist, that God would somehow reach him. \n",
      " \n",
      "One evening as he was praying the words to this hymn came to his head. He jotted them down and that same night handed the lyrics and the tune to the soloist. As the soloist sang, he was visibly moved and decided to stay for the sermon. That night, at the atlar call, he got up, went to the front of the tent, and accepted Jesus. \n",

      "Crown Him with Many Crowns is one of those hymns that seem to appear slightly different in every hymnal. There's a good reason for this. The original version was written by Matthew Bridges in 1851. Bridges considered this hymn a \"sermon in song\" and titled it \"The Song of the Seraphs,\" basing the lyrics on Revelation 19:12. While Bridges at one time was a devout Anglican who even had written a book condemning Roman Catholic theology, several years prior to writing the lyrics to this hymn he had actually converted to Catholicism, leaving the Church of England along with John Henry Newman. \n",
      " \n",
      "More than 20 years later, the hymn gained huge popularity. Godfrey Thring, a devout Anglican clergyman, was concerned that this new-popular hymn's lyrics was perhaps too heavy in Catholic theology (particularly his second verse). He ended up writing six completely new verses for the hymn. Even though Bridges was alive at the time, there was no record of him commenting on these changes, nor of the two men even meeting. \n",
      " \n",
      "Interestingly, over the years, this hymn has remained immensely popular. But instead of people choosing Bridges' version over Thring's or vice-versa, hymnal editors and singers began to intersperse the two sets of lyrics. Today, most hymnals tend to use a combination of three verses by Bridges and one verse by Thring. Although in three different hymnals I checked, there were three completely different arrangements using combinations of both men's lyrics. It's funny how things work out, but the resulting hymn often ends up being one that Catholics, Anglicans, and singers of every Christian denomination can sing with fervor and without controversy. \n",

      "Karolina's words were paired with Oskar Ahnfelt's music and the hymns helped influence a religious revival throughout the Scandanavian countries in the latter half of the 19th century. Karlolina signed her hymns \"L.S.\", which she was affectionately known by throughout Sweden. She has been falled the \"Fanny Crosby of Sweden\" for her prolific hymn work. \n",

The words fit the music Tullar had composed perfectly the day before. He immediately thought to himself, \"These words convey a stronger message with my tune than my own. I'll use these, for I feel God will bless these words to many hears.\"\n",

      "Fairest Lord Jesus is one of those hymns that has stood the test of time, having been composed over 335 years ago and yet is still being sung by Christians everywhere today. The text of the hymn dates back to at least 1662 in Germany, and the hymn seems to have achieved popularity in 1677 when it was included in a Jesuit hymn book called Munster Gesangbuch. The tune is called the \"Crusader's Hymn\", as legend says that the music was sung during the time of the Crusades, although no evidence exists to prove or disprove that.\n",

Some attribute most of the lyrics to Richard Storrs Willis, who also adapted the music (Willis is also known as the composer of the tune \"Carol\" to which we sing It Came Upon the Midnight Clear). Others attribute large portions of the lyrics to Joseph Augustus Seiss, who adapted the words and music to a hymn titled Beautiful Savior.\n",
      " \n",
      "Regardless of the source, the words today are even more meaningful than they were 300 years ago. We live in an age today where political correctness is more important than the search for Truth. There are those who say that Jesus Christ was just a philospher, just a leader of a movement, just a historical figure whose time has come and gone. Even mentioning Jesus' words \"no one comes to the Father except by Me\" are met with cries of being \"intolerant\", \"bigoted\", \"hateful\", just as much as in Jesus' day when he proclaimed \"I and the Father are one\" and was nearly stoned on the spot for saying it. \n",

      "Not much is known about Folliott Sandford Pierpoint, the author of this hymn who was born on October 7, 1835 in Bath, England. We do know that he graduated from Queens College at Cambridge and taught at Somersetshire College, and spent most of his life in Bath and the southwest of England.  He was a prolific hymn writer in his day, having published a compilation of poems called The Chalice of Nature and Other Poems.  \n",
      " \n",
      "This, his most famous hymn, was written when he was 29. As he walked along the countryside on a beautiful day in spring, he saw the vast ocean, the blue skies, and the Avon river winding through beautiful wildflowers. Inspired by the beauty of creation, he wrote down this poem, originally intended for communion services in his local Anglican Church, but soon it found a life of its own worldwide across Christianity everywhere. \n",

      "In this day and age where so many of us exist in our own cramped confines in cities and suburbia and find ourselves spending most of our times cramped between four walls, it's sometimes easy to forget how beautiful this earth that God created is. On a beautiful spring or summer day, why not take some time to get away from the bustling humanity and rediscover the beauty of God's creation? And while you're admiring it, don't forget to close your eyes and just say a quick thanks to the One who made it for you. \n",

      "William Arms Fisher was a pupil of famed composer Antonin Dvorak, studying under Dvorak in New York City. A native of Prague, in 1893, Dvorak composed his most famous symphony, the Symphony No. 9 in E Minor \"From the New World\". It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and was an homage to the United States, which had just passed its 100th anniversary of being a country. \n",
      " \n",
      "Contrary to popular belief, Dvorak did not base the symphony on any existing folk songs. Rather, he wrote original themes based on what he'd heard of Native American and African American music in the United States. The symphony was met with immediate success at its premier on December 16, 1893 at Carnegie Hall.\n",
      " \n",
      "In a newspaper interview,  for the New York Herald in 1893, Dvorak challenged American composers to look at their own country's rich heritage of native music to draw their inspiration from. His full quote: \"in the Negro melodies of America I   discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music. They   are pathétic, tender, passionate, melancholy, solemn, religious, bold,   merry, gay or what you will. It is music that suits itself to any mood   or purpose. There is nothing in the whole range of composition that   cannot be supplied with themes from this source. The American musician   understands these tunes and they move sentiment in him.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "William Arms Fisher took up the challenge, starting by penning words to the Largo melody of the second movement of Dvorak's symphony. He also published a volume of called \"Seventy Negro Spirituals\" in 1926. Today, many people assume that the tune was always an African American spiritual that was adapted to the symphony, but in fact the opposite is true in this case. \n",

      "Thomas Chisholm wrote 1,200 poems and hymns in his lifetime until he passed away in 1960 at the age of 94. In addition to this hymn, he wrote such loved hymns as O To Be Like Thee and Living for Jesus. But it's this hymn, Great Is Thy Faithfulness, which has become one of the most loved hymns of the 20th century. \n",
      " \n",
      "Chisholm came to Christ at the age of 27, but his life wasn't easy. Even at a young age he encountered bouts of illnesses and had a hard time keeping a steady career, bouncing from job to job and encountering the ups and downs of life. \n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn started as one of several poems that Chisholm sent to his friend, musician William Runyan. Runyan was so moved by this hymn that he prayed for guidance to compose the music. In 1923, Runyan published the hymn in one of his private song pamphlets. \n",
      " \n",
      "Years later, the president of the Moody Bible Institute Will Houghton took a liking to the hymn and led the singing of it in chapel service so much that it became an unofficial theme some for the Bible Instititute. It was even sung during Houghton's funeral services. \n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn fell into relative obscurity again until it started to be sung at Billy Graham Crusades, when it became popular throughout the world and remains to do this day. \n",
      " \n",
      "Why is this hymn so popular? Like so many great hymns, it's because it's so deeply steeped in the Word of God. Reading the words of Jeremiah in Lamentations 3 is one thing, but singing it to the beautiful melody is another. Just like Jeremiah did in his day, and just like Chisholm in his day, today there are times in all our lives where we face extreme uncertainty and heartache and change. And yet how amazing is it to go to sleep and wake up in the morning, feel the sun shining on your face, and be filled with joy that no matter what happens in life, God is still God and His love never fails. \n",

      "Alfred Ackley   was born on January 21, 1887. As a young man he was a gifted musician, studying composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London and recognized as an accomplished cellist. He decided to join the ministry, attending Westminster Theological Seminary and becoming ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1914, serving congregations in Pennslylvania and then California. Throughout his ministry he always kept up his interest in hymns and hymn tunes. Word is that he wrote over 1,500 hymns in his lifetime, \"He Lives\" being the one that has become a favorite we still sing today.\n",
      " \n",
      "One day in 1932, Ackley held an evangelistic meeting where he spoke about Jesus. A young Jewish man was in the audience. During one of their conversations, the young man asked the question, \"Why should I worship a dead Jew?\"\n",
      " \n",
      "In today's politically charged times such a question would probably start an argument or at least a loud, heated, and defensive exchange. But Ackley could see the sincerity in the young man and gave a loving and enthusiastic response:\n",
      " \n",
      "\"He lives! I tell you, He is not dead, but lives here and now! Jesus Christ is more alive today than ever before. I can prove it by my own experience, as well as the testimony of countless thousands.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Not long after, Ackley was at his home preparing for the Easter Sunday service when a famous  radio preacher from New York came on the radio. He was astonished at the message this preacher gave. \"Good morning! It's Easter! You know, folks, it really doesn't make any diference to me if Christ be risen or not. As far as I am concerned, His body could be as dust in some Palestinian tomb. The main thing is, His truth goes marching on.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Ackley was incensed when he heard this message going out to countless people on the airwaves. \"It's a lie!\" he shouted. His wife heard the ruckus and asked him what was wrong. \"Didn't you hear what that good-for-nothing preacher said?\" Ackley responded. \n",
      " \n",
      "He delivered his Easter message that day, but at night he was still agitated. His wife finally challenged him to do what he did best: write a song about it. The scriptures he used to prepare for his message, the testimony of the innumerable cloud of witnesses, and the burning in his own heart came together to form the lyrics and music of \"He Lives\", which we are still singing eighty years later. \n",
      " \n",
      "It's funny how 80 years later not much has changed. These days you will hear radio and TV commentators and even theologians and so-called clergy talk about Jesus as \"a Jewish philosopher\", nothing more, nothing less. They put Him in the same category as the ancient philosophers and classify his ministry as no different than other religious movements. \n",
      " \n",
      "But for those who really know and serve Jesus, they experience not a 2,000 old religious movement, but with the Holy Spirit within them they can feel renewed every day. They can feel his mercy, his care, and his guidance. They feel comforted in sorrow and protected in trouble. \n",
      " \n",
      "What's the difference between being a follower of Christ and a follower of other philosophical and religious movements? The difference is that every religious philospher and leader of a movement died, and was buried, and their bones remain where they were buried. But with Christ the stone was rolled away from the empty tomb. And what a difference it is. \n",

      "Reverend Johnson Oatman, Jr. lived from 1856 to 1921. He joined the Methodist church at age 19. He was  licensed to preach and even ordained, but he ended up never pastoring a church. Instead, he became a businessman, busy first in a mercantile business and later in the insurance business. \n",
      " \n",
      "For many, the story would end there. But for Oatman, around the time he was 36 he started writing gospel songs. Between then and his death at age 65, he wrote an estimated 5,000 hymns in his \"free time\". That's about 4-5 new texts a week. His lyrics were in great demand by the leading gospel musicians of the day, and yet he never received more than $1.00 for any of his songs. Some of those songs include hymns that still continue to be sung and well loved today such as \"Count Your Blessings\" and \"No, Not One\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Sometimes, especially in today's world, it seems that we need to choose between serving God and having a career. There's even the misconception that the only ones who really \"serve God\" are the ones who give up their careers and devote themselves full-time to a ministry or a charity. While those are certainly high callings, I really appreciate the example that Johnson Oatman left. He proved that having a career and serving God doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. All you need to do is know the gifts that God has given you, be willing to use them, and pray that He lift you above the world to higher ground. Once this happens, there's no telling what good works He will use you for. \n",

      "Civilla Durfee Martin wrote many popular hymns that are still familiar today, including \"God Will Take Care of You\" and \"The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power\". Her husband Walter Stillman Martin was a minister, but also wrote many of the hymn tunes for her lyrics, although the tune to this particular hymn was written by Charles Gabriel (who wrote the music to an enormous number of hymns still sung today including \"Send the Light\", \"Higher Ground\", \"He Lifted Me\", \"I Stand Amazed in the Presence\", \"The Way of the Cross Leads Home\", \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Crown Him with Many Crowns\", \"Since Jesus Came Into My Heart\", and many, many more.\n",
      " \n",
      "Civilla Martin recounted the story of how the lyrics of this hymn came to her.  She and her husband were dear friends with a couple in Elmira, New York, named Mr. and Mrs. Doolittle, whom she described as \"true saints of God\". Mr. Doolittle was disabled and had to use a wheelchair to move. Mrs. Doolittle had an illness that kept her bedridden for twenty years. And yet every time the Martins would visit the Doolittles, they were struck at how bright, optimistic, and at peace they were. During one visit, they asked Mrs. Doolittle if she ever got discouraged. She responded about God's care for the sparrow. The words struck Civilla deeply, and shortly after she wrote the poem we know today as \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\". \n",

      " \n",
      "An English missionary names Stuart Hine heard the poem being sung and arranged the words and the music to become the familiar ones we hear today. Hines explained how he arrivved at each of the four verses while living in the Carpathian mountains of Russia. The first verse, he said, was writen when he was caught in a thunderstorm in a village. The second verse was written near the Romanian border, when he heard birds singing. The third verse was written when he saw many of the Carpathian villagers and mountain people coming to accept Christ. And the fourth was written once he was home in England. \n",
      " \n",
      "Again, the hymn didn't achieve widespread attention until Dr. J Edwin Orr (a reknowned Baptist minister who among other things penned the lyrics to \"Search Me, O God\") heard the hymn sung in India. He brought to back to the United States. It finally achieved widespread popularity when George Beverly Shea (famed singer and author of \"I'd Rather Have Jesus\") sung it at a Billy Graham crusade. \n",

      "Annie Sherwood Hawks was born in 1835. From a young age she had a talent for writing poetry. At age 24, she got married and moved to Brooklyn, NY. She and her husband were members of the church in Brooklyn whose pastor happened to be Robert S. Lowry, famed hymn writer who composed many of the hymns we still sing today, including \"Nothing But the Blood\", \"Low in the Grave He Lay\", \"Shall We Gather at the River\", and \"We're Marching to Zion\".\n",
      " \n",
      "Dr. Lowry saw Annie's talent right away and encouraged her to keep writing. He even issued a challenge to her: \"If you'll write the words, I'll write the music\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Surely enough, in 1872 at the age of 37, Annie wrote the lyrics to \"I Need Thee Every Hour\". Toward the end of her like, she would describe the circumstances under which she wrote the hymn:\n",
      " \n",
      "It was a bright June day, and I became so filled with the sense of the nearness of my Master that I began to wonder how anyone could live without Him, in either joy or pain. Suddenly, the words \"I need Thee every hour\" flashed into my mind and very quickly the thought had full possession of me.\n",
      " \n",
      "Seating myself by the open windows, I caught up my pencil and committed the words to paper--almost as they are today. A few months later Dr. Robert Lowry composed the tune for my hymn, and also added the refrain.\n",
      " \n",
      "For myself, the hymn at its writing was prophetic rather than expressive of my own experiences, for it was wafted out to the world on the wings of love and joy, instead of under the stress of great personal sorrow, with which it has often been assocated. \n",
      " \n",
      "At first I did not understand why the hymn so greatly touched the throbbing heart of humanity. Years later, however, under the shadow of a great loss I came to understand something of the comforting power of the words I had been permitted to give out to others in my hours of sweet serenity and peace.\n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn was first performed in November 1872 at the National Sunday School Convention in Cincinatti, Ohio. It was adopted by the evangelistic team of Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey, and from there it found worldwide popularity. It was even featured at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and has been translated into many languages. \n",

      "Ruth Caye Jones was the wife of a minister and also the mother of five. While we constantly hear of wars and rumors of wars today, it's sometimes easy to forget that things were much worse in the dark days of World War II. The US casualty count of the war in Afghanistan recently reached 2,000, a number far, far too great. And yet during World War II, over 400,000 young US soldiers lost their lives. And that number itself was just a small part of the 78 million people who died worldwide. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was during this time that Mother Jones, as she came to be known, reflected on the words of 2 Timothy 3:1, took a small notepad from her apron pocket, and jotted down the words and music to \"In Times Like These\", exactly as we sing them today. \n",
      " \n",
      "As with many great hymns of the era, In Times Like These was a popular choice of George Beverly Shea to be sung at Billy Graham Crusades. The first time Jones heard her song sung on television, tears came to her eyes. \"I can't believe I had any part in writing this song. I just feel that God gave it to me, and I gave it to the world.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Today, we still live in perilous times. And unlike in the 1940s, we as a society have grown further and further from God. The Solid Rock is still there and always has been, but we as a people have chosen to throw our anchor on sinking sand. \n",
      " \n",
      "So the words that Mother Jones wrote 50 years ago ring more true today than they ever have. In our lives, whether we're talking about us as a society or within our own families, we will encounter storms of life, some which threaten to tear our whole ships apart. But if your anchor grips onto the solid rock, there is no storm that can destroy you. \n",

      "C. Austin Miles lived from 1868 to 1946. He started life as a pharmacist, but wrote his first gospel song when he was 24 years old. His song was published by the Hall-Mack company. Miles gave up his life as a pharmacist and went on to serve as an editor and manager of Hall-Mack publishers for 37 years. He was quoted as saying, \"It is as a writer of gospel songs I am proud to be known, for in that way I may be of the most use of my Master, whom I serve willingly although not as efficiently as I desire.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Miles got his wish. Even  today, over 60 years after his death, some of his hymns have stood the test of time, from the beautiful \"Living in Beulah Land\" to the catchy \"A New Name in Glory\" to the ubiquitous children's song \"Wide, Wide as the Ocean.\" \"In the Garden\" is one of his most-loved hymns. According to Miles, the original inspiration for the hymn occurred when he read the passage in the gospels where Mary Magdalene encounters Jesus on the morning of the resurrection. Miles felt as if he were standing there witnessing the reunion between Mary and her Lord. Then he thought, \"This is not an experience limited to a happening almost 2000 years ago, but it is the daily companionship with the Savior that makes up the Christian's daily walk.\" \n",

      "  Horatio Spafford was a successful businessman who lived in Chicago back in 1828-1888. \n",
      "\n",
      "          In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire happened …one of the greatest disasters of their time, similar to how Hurricane Katrina, the Asian Tsunami, and the earthquake in Japan are disasters of our time. Many people lost all their possessions. Worse, Horatio Spafford’s son had died of scarlet fever at the age of 4 just prior to the Chicago Fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "          It was around that time that Mr. Spafford decided to make a new start, and to move his family overseas. He arranged to sell what was left of his property, and he bought tickets for himself, his wife, and his four daughters on a ship to take them to Europe. From there, they would move to Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "          Right before the ship was to set sail, Spafford found out that one of the sales of his property had fallen through. So he sent his wife and his daughters on ahead, while he went back to take care of the sale of his property. He would take the next ship and join them in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "          A few days later, Horatio Spafford received a telegram. It was signed by his wife. And there were only two words on it. “Saved alone”.\n",
      "\n",
      "          The ship that Horatio Spafford’s family was on was struck by another ship. It sank quickly. Spafford’s wife made it. But his four little girls did not. They lost their lives when the ship went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spafford soon sailed across the Atlantic to join his grieving wife in Europe. While he was halfway across the Atlantic, the captain called him to the bridge. He pointed out the exact location that his daughters lost their lives, as they sailed past it.It was then that Spafford wrote the words to a poem, which became this hymn. You can see a photo of the original manuscript by clicking on the image to the right. \n",
      "\n",
      "          Sometimes you make plans for your life, and the plans go up in flames. One minute you might be surrounded by your loved ones. The next moment you may be all alone. Sometimes things happen that in a million years you can never explain. It’s easy to say that you have faith in God when things are good. But when things are bad, can you say the same words that Spafford wrote here? \"Whatever my lot, it is well with my soul?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "          How could a man who lost his son, lost his business, and lost his four daughters possibly say that things were well with his soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "        People in the world look everywhere for peace. Banks and insurance companies say that having money, that’s what brings you peace and security. If you go to a store, you’ll see them sell aromatherapy candles and shampoo and soap that are supposed to bring peace to you. Some say that listening to light music can bring peace to you. Others say that seeing therapists will do the trick. Others rely on meditation and yoga. But this is all peace as the world gives.These things might bring some temporary relaxation, but they don’t bring peace to the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "          True peace only comes from one source:\n",
      "\n",
      "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "          In life, sometimes things can get chaotic. Sometimes you will feel alone, sometimes you will feel afraid. In this world we will have trouble. But the remarkable thing is, when you really know Christ you have the blessed assurance that you’re never really alone. And because of this you never need to be afraid. Because as chaotic as life gets, He has things under control. He will not leave you alone. He has already done all he can, by taking your sins away, not because we deserve it, but because of his love. And nothing can separate you from that love. \n",

      " \n",
      "The poem was originally the the second part of a poem about Psalm 98 written in Watt's book The Psalms of Daved, imitated in the language of the New Testament and applied to the Christian state, a book Watts started writing when his health started to decline at age 45. \n",
      " \n",

      "\n",
      "Praise for the gospel\n",

      "The second part of the poem was verbatim what we sing today (with the last line repeated twice). This was called PSALM XCVIII. Second Part. (C.M.) and was subtitled The Messiah's coming and kingdom. So the poem we sing today as a Christmas carol was actually originally written about Christ's second coming. But happily, it works for both. \n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn, of course, gained popularity when in 1836 Lowell Mason arranged a tune out of themes in George F. Handel's Messiah, specifically from Comfort Ye, Lift Up Your Heads, and Glory to God. \n",
      "\n",
      "Isaac Watts has been called \"The Father of English Hymnody\". Over two centuries after his death, his sings are still being sung today. Among the over 600 hymns he wrote in his lifetime are familiar hymns as Alas and Did My Savior Bleed, At the Cross, We're Marching to Zion, I Sing the Mighty Power of God, O God Our Help in Ages Past, This is the Day the Lord Has Made, When I Can Read My Title Clear, and When I Survey the Wondrous Cross. Ironically, during his day his poems were viewed by many in the church as \"worldly\", as church congregants of the day were accustomed to chanting Old Testament Psalms put to poetic form, some of which were so awkwardly and unnatural that John and Charles Wesley's father Samuel called them \"scandalous doggerel\". Following the Lord's teachings that worship should be in spirit and in truth, Watts wrote poems that cut to the heart and make worship come alive, even for Christians today. \n",

      "Most people today associate the hymn \"Morning Has Broken\" with the popular recording the former Cat Stevens released in 1972. But the hymn was actually written 40 years earlier in 1931 by celebrated English children's book author Eleanor Farjeon. In fact, aside from being published in 1931 in the hymnal \"Songs of Praise\", the hymn was also published as a poem called \"A Morning Song (for the First Day of Spring) in a children's poetry book published by Oxford University Press in 1957. \n",
      " \n",
      "This was a case where the words were created to fit a Gaelic tune called \"Bunessan\", which has its roots in the Scottish highlands. The beautiful tune has been used for many different lyrics, including a Christmas carol that predates \"Morning Has Broken\" which starts \"Child in the manger, infant of Mary\", as well as contemporary uses such as a baptism hymn that starts \"Baptized in Water, sealed in the Spirit\", and a wedding hymn that starts \"Vows have been spoken, prayers have been offered\". But of course it's Farjeon's words that have stuck \n",

      "This is the line that jumps out at me when I sing this hymn. The words are by Sarah F. Adams, inspired by the words of Genesis 28. Sarah Adams was no stranger to suffering. Her mother died when she was 5 years old. Her dream was to be an actress, not because she wanted attention, but because she felt that could be a ministry to people. But her health prevented her from doing this, so she turned to writing. She wrote this hymn at the age of 36. She died seven years later of tuberculosis.\n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn itself has a storied history. In 1901, President McKinley, after being fatally shot, was reported to have said as his last words “‘Nearer, my God, to Thee, e’en though it be a cross’ has been my constant prayer”. In 1912, survivors of the Titanic recounted that this is what the ship’s band played as they knew they were dying.\n",
      " \n",
      "But when you sing the lyrics of the hymn, you’ll find that it’s not so much about dying, as it is about living. About new beginnings. About brushing the dust off and going on.\n",
      " \n",
      "The inspiration for this hymn was Genesis 28.\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob had just left home for the first time. He had just left his family. The brother he had grown up with now wanted to kill him. His mother told him to leave home because of that. His father’s health was ailing.\n",
      " \n",
      "So, he set out, not sure of what was in store for him. Years later, he would refer to these days as “the day of my distress”.\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.\n",
      " \n",
      "For all of his life, Jacob had been surrounded by his family, by servants, by animals, by good food, by a life filled with all his heart desired. Now, for the first time, he was alone, with nothing. He found a stone to use as a pillow and slept on the ground. One can only imagine how many tears this young man, suddenly so alone in the world, shed on that stone as he fell asleep.\n",
      " \n",
      "And that’s when God gave him His promise. “I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob did something right. He woke up, and then he took the stone on which he was sleeping, and he built an altar. He made a vow. He vowed that if the Lord did all He said, then the Lord would be his God, and the stone he set up would be God’s house (Beth-El), and he would dedicate a tenth of all he was given to the Lord.\n",
      " \n",
      "Perhaps you're in a situation in life where you've lost all hope. Maybe you feel alone, and afraid, and unable to go on. If so, read these words again. But instead of reading the ones that God said to Jacob, read the ones that His Son says to you:\n",
      " \n",
      "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20).\n",
      " \n",
      "If you’ve encountered a tremendous loss, a loss beyond what words can express, nothing anyone says or does can bring what you’ve lost back. But where to go from here is your choice.\n",
      " \n",
      "You have two choices. You can continue to wallow in self-pity and regret. You can dwell on the past, trying whatever you can do to conjure back a past which is gone forever. Trust me, I know the temptation is great to do this.\n",
      " \n",
      "Or you can wake up, and remember what it is that the Lord told you. And from there, you can make a new beginning. You can take your stony griefs and raise your own Bethel, the house of God, in your heart.\n",
      " \n",
      "What does this mean? Well, there’s an interesting thing about enduring terrible loss. Prayer suddenly becomes a lot easier. Why? Because it’s only in the rough times that we realize that only God has the ability to understand us and help us. Like Joseph took that heavy stone on which he laid his head, take your griefs and lay them before God. Use them to build that altar--that marker in the ground which marks the first day of a new beginning.\n",
      " \n",
      "No matter what has happened in the past, no matter what mistakes you’ve made, or losses you’ve endured…there’s one thing you can do. Make a clean new start. Pray a prayer like Jacob did. Ask God to watch over you on the journey you are taking. Ask God to give you what you need to sustain you through the journey, wherever it takes you.\n",
      " \n",
      "Years later, Jacob returned to that same spot. Only this time, he returned married, children in tow, having been blessed immeasurably by God. It was here that he looked back and thought back to that day as a young man when he slept alone on this ground. He knew that God had indeed been with him wherever he had gone. And it was not long after that when Jacob was renamed Israel by God, and that he heard from God Himself how vast his descendants would be, and how from him nations and kings would come.\n",
      " \n",
      "Whatever state you’re in today, sing this hymn. Think of how despite the loss you’ve gone through, that out of your stony griefs, God is waiting to hear that prayer from you. That prayer that turns to him for help. That prayer that says that you wish nothing more than to be nearer to Him and to have Him be with you…from your own Bethel to the end of the age.\n",

She was the wife of Leander Lycurgus Pickett, a Methodist evangelist who himself wrote music or lyrics for several hymns.The two of them were active in the Methodist church and in the founding of Asbury College in Kentucky (now Asbury University). Their son Jarrell W. Pickett went on to serve as a missionary to India for 46 years who, among other things, brought unprecedented medical care to India, organized volunteer work in Delhi, and met with presidents (Truman and Eisenhower) and prime ministers (Nehru) alike. \n",

But at those moments, get on your knees and pour out yourself to Jesus. Cast your burden on Him, because He cares for you. \n",

      "O Holy Night started as a French Christmas carol written in 1847. A wine commissionaire of a small French town, Placide Cappeau de Roquemaure, was known throughout the town for his poetry, and one day the local parish priest asked him to write a poem for Christmas mass. Using the gospel of Luke as his guide, Cappeau imagined himself in Bethlehem witnessing the birth of Jesus. \n",
      " \n",
      "Cappeau felt that his poem needed music, so he reached out to one of his friends, Adolphe Charles Adams, the son of a well-known classical musician and a student of the Paris conservatoire. Even though Adams was Jewish, he was inspired by Cappeau's beautiful words to write an equally beautiful score, which was performed at Christmas mass just three weeks later.\n",
      " \n",
      "\"Cantique De Noel\" became a popular hymn throughout the churches in France. But in time, Cappeau would leave the church to join the socialist movement. The church leaders also discovered that the composer of the music was Jewish. Soon, the church officially denounced the song and banned it as unfit for church services because of its \"lack of musical taste\" and \"total absence of the spirit or religion\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Despite the church's official stance on the song, people in France continued to sing it. Legend has it that on Christmas Eve of 1871 when the Franco-Prussian war between France and Germany was at its fiercest, a soldier in the French army jumped out of a trench with no weapon and sang \"Minuit, Chretiens, c'est l'heure solennelle ou L'Homme Dieu descendit jusqu'a nous\". After completing all three verses of \"Cantique de Noel\", a German soldier climbed out of his hiding place and sang Martin Luther's \"From Heaven Above to Earth I Come\". The story goes that this brought on a 24 hour temporary truce in honor of Christmas Day. \n",
      " \n",
      "In a move that would further solidify the hymn's popularity, an American writer named John Sullivan Dwight translated the lyrics to English. Dwight was an ardent abolitionist, so the third verse that read \"Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother\" especially resonated with him. He published the English lyrics in his magazine, and the song took off in the United States, starting in the North. \n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn had yet another interesting place in history. On Christmas Eve 1906, a professor named Reginald Fessenden, a former chief chemist for Thomas Edison, using a new type of generator, spoke into a microphone, and for the first time in history broadcast his voice signals over the airwaves. Around the world, speakers that had been designed to listen for coded impulses now carried a human voice for the first time. For the first words ever to be broadcast on radio, he chose the text of Luke 2. He then played \"O Holy Night\" on his violin, the first song ever to be played over the radio. \n",

      " \n",
      "Chapman went through his own trials as a young man. His mother died when he was thirteen. At age 19 while studying for the ministry, he had doubts about his commitment, sometimes feeling he was saved and sometimes doubting. Dwight L. Moody himself counseled the young man, assuring him using the words of John 5:24. Since then, Chapman never looked back. \n",
      " \n",
      "At age 24, Chapman was married to Irene E. Steddon, with whom he began pastoring churches in Ohio and Indiana. Sadly, his wife would die only four years later, shortly after the birth of their daughter. Confused and discouraged, Chapman's life was changed when he listened to paster and evangelist F.B. Meyer speak at a conference: \"If you are not willing to give up everything for Christ, are you willing to be made willing.\" According to Chapman, \"that remark changed my whole ministry; it seemed like a new star in the sky of my life.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Chapman did eventually remarry and had four more children.  He went on to minister a church in Philadelphia, where one of the congregants told him \"You are not a very strong preacher, but a few of us have decided to gather and pray every Sunday morning for you.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "The church eventually grew eventually to 12,000 congregants, giving it the largest Sunday School membership and making it the largest Presbyterian church in the world. Chapman became nationally known as well and he began to assist his college friend B. Fay Mills and Moody in their evangelistic events, as well as holding his own revivals throughout the northeastern US and Canada. In 1895 Dwight L. Moody called him \"the greatest evangelist in the country.\" He carried on Moody's tradition of holding mass evangelistic events, which continued with Billy Sunday in the early 20th century (who got his start in Chapman's crusades) and Billy Graham in the late 20th century. It was said that Chapman delivered over 50,000 sermons in his ministry, reaching 60 million people, in the the days before radio, television, and the Internet. \n",

      "Reverend Augustus Montague Toplady wrote the hymn \"Rock of Ages\" in 1763. It was published 12 years later in The Gospel Magazine in 1775. The story goes that the Reverend Toplady was walking along the gorge of Burrington Combe in England when he found himself in the middle of a huge thunderstorm. With rain lashing down, he ran into a nearby cave for shelter. While waiting for the storm to clear, he thought about how just as the rocks were providing him shelter from the storm, so to does Jesus, our rock, provide us shelter from the \"storms of life\" if we choose to hide ourselves in Him. \n",

      "Will Lamartine Thompson was born in 1847 in a small town in Ohio. He attended Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, but because of his great musical talent he went on to study music at the Boston Conservatory of Music and in Leipzig, Germany. \n",
      " \n",
      "Thompson wrote mainly secular and patriotic songs as a young man. When he tried to sell his songs to publishers in Cleveland, he was rejected. But eventually he went to New York, worked with a printer to publish his own music. His music became the big hits of the day, including songs like \"My Home on the Old Ohio\" and \"Gathering Shells from the Sea\". We may not be familiar with these songs today, but suffice it to say his music were some of the top pop hits of his day, so much so that he eventually started his own publishing company, sold millions of copies of his music, and became a millionaire. And he achieved all this in his 20's. \n",
      " \n",
      "He didn't let fame or fortune go to his head, though. In his 30's, to give thanks to God for the success he enjoyed, he dedicated himself to writing only Christian songs from that point on. While no one remembers his secular music today, we still sing his hymns. If you've sung Jesus Is All the World To Me, There's a Great Day Coming, or Softly and Tenderly Jesus Is Calling, you're familiar with just a few of the hymns he wrote. \n",
      " \n",
      "In his later life, while he could have been like other famous musicians and travelled to huge cities to huge crowds, Thompson opted to take his upright piano on a two-horse wagon and perform to small church congregations in cities throughout the Midwest. \n",
      " \n",
      "Today, it is said that Softly and Tenderly has been translated into more languages than any other hymn in history.  In 1890, as famed evangelist Dwight L. Moody was dying, Thompson came to visit him. Taking Thompson by the hand, Moody told him \"Will, I would rather have written 'Softly and Tenderly Jesus Is Calling' than anything else I have been able to do in my whole life.' The hymn was played at Dr. Martin Luther King's memorial services in 1968. \n",

      "In 1845, British minister Reverend Thomas Salmon sent the lyrics to this hymn to the popular newspaper The New York Observer with the following note: \n",
      "\n",
      "During my residence at Coleshill, Warwickshire, England, I became acquainted with W. W. Walford, the blind preacher, a man of obscure birth and connections and no education, but of strong mind and most retentive memory. In the pulpit he never failed to select a lesson well adapted to his subject, giving chapter and verse with unerring precision and scarcely ever misplacing a word in his repetition of the Psalms, every part of the New Testament, the prophecies, and some of the histories, so as to have the reputation of \"knowing the whole Bible by heart.\n",
      " \n",
      "He actually sat in the chimney corner, employing his mind in composing a sermon or two for Sabbath delivery, and his hands in cutting, shaping and polishing bones for shoe horns and other little useful implements. At intervals he attempted poetry. On one occasion, paying him a visit, he repeated two or three pieces which he had composed, and having no friend at home to commit them to paper, he had laid them up in the storehouse within. \"How will this do?\" asked he, as he repeated the following lines, with a complacent smile touched with some light lines of fear lest he subject himself to criticism. I rapidly copied the lines with my pencil, as he uttered them, and sent them for insertion in the Observer, if you should think them worthy of preservation.\n",
      " \n",
      "Happily, the Observer did think the words to \"Sweet Hour of Prayer\" worth of preservation and printed them in their September 13, 1845 edition. It wasn't until years later in 1861 that composer William Bradbury wrote the tune to the hymn, and it wasn't until 15 years after that the hymn was first published in a Methodist hymnal. Reverend Salmon passed away in 1852, well before this, and despite attempts to track him down, no one ever found the blind preacher named W.W. Walford that the Reverend spoke of. Chances are neither of them would ever know how popular this poem would become. \n",
      " \n",
      "Years ago when I was a young kid working at AT&T, I remember the then-CEO Bob Allen was coming to visit our little office in New Jersey. My boss and her boss and her boss's boss, and her boss's boss's boss all became extremely nervous. We had to thoroughly clean the office top to bottom weeks before the CEO's arrival. Certain people were selected to speak to the CEO if the opportunity were to come up. Everyone was told to dress a certain way and even were told what they could and couldn't have on their desks. \n",
      " \n",
      "The big day finally came. Bob Allen and his entourage walked by. I saw a brief glimpse of him. And then it was over. \n",
      " \n",
      "I just remember chuckling to myself of how silly it was for everyone to get so worked up about seeing this man and having the \"honor\" of being in his presence for 2 minutes. And yet we find it a chore to get on our knees for 2 minutes to have a one-on-one conversation with the creator of the universe. \n",
      " \n",
      "I think this is where this hymn really hits home for me. Prayer really shouldn't be a chore or a thing to check off a list. It's a great honor and privilege where we should feel joy in communicating with our Creator and yearn to do so again each day. \n",

      "Helen H. Lemmel was born in England in 1863. She immigrated to the United States as a child, where she studied music and became a gifted vocalist. She returned to Europe to continue her music study and eventually married a wealthy European. But in midlife she went through multiple heartache. She became blind, and around the same time her husband left her. \n",
      " \n",
      "Lemmel was a gifted hymn writer who wrote nearly 500 hymns during her lifetime. The most well known of these was Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus, which was originally titled \"The Heavenly Vision\". The lyrics were inspired by a tract read to her that was written by Lilias Trotter. It read:\n",
      " \n",
      " Never has it been so easy to live in half a dozen harmless worlds at once -- art, music, social science, games, motoring, the following of some profession, and so on. And between them we run the risk of drifting about, the good hiding the best.\" It is easy to find out whether our lives are focused, and if so, where the focus lies. Where do our thoughts settle when consciousness comes back in the morning? Where do they swing back when the pressure is off during the day? Dare to have it out with God, and ask Him to show you whether or not all is focused on Christ and His Glory. Turn your soul's vision to Jesus, and look and look at Him, and a strange dimness will come over all that is apart from Him.\n",
      " \n",
      "The words ring even more true today than they did 100 years ago. Our world is filled with so many distractions, diversions, and things that would turn us away from God. When so many of us are mired in our careers or our entertainment or managing our homes, how many of us \"Dare to have it out with God\" and turn our soul's vision back to Jesus? \n",
      " \n",
      "Lemmel said that when she heard these words, she \"stood still, and singing in my soul and spirit was the chorus, with not one conscious moment of putting word to word to make rhyme or not to make melody. The verses were written the same week, after the usual manner of composition, but nonetheless dictated by the Holy Spirit.\" \n",

He was educated at the Hall-Moody Institute in Martin, Tennessee, a prominent Baptist college, where he trained in music. After school he became a mugh sought-after music teacher. He travelled throughout the South holding music schools, teaching anyone who was interested how to sight read music using shape notes. He was also an aspiring songwriter. \n",
      " \n",
      "In 1918, he along with friends David Moore and John McClung would establish the Hartford Music Company in Hartford, Arkansas. The company helped establish the new genre of music that we know of today as Southern Gospel music, publishing shape note songbooks for use in conventions around the country. He wrote most of the songs himself. Bartlett and his company were heavily influential in the development of religious music, making it accessible to millions upon millions of people. \n",
      " \n",
      "Bartlett also established the Hartford Music Institute as a way to teach music and also provide an outlet for their songs. In 1926, he would sponsor and mentor a young songwriter named Alfred Brumley to attend his school. Brumley of course would go on to become perhaps the best-known Southern Gospel songwriter of all time, writing such songs as \"I'll Fly Away\", \"Turn Your Radio On\", \"I'll Meet You in the Morning\", and many more. 20 years later, Brumley himself would purchase the Hartform Music Company. Southern gospel music would continue to evolve as a musical genre in itself, and would go on to be a major influence on many other kinds of music, from country to rock and roll. \n",
      " \n",
      "Bartlett's songs were recorded by the leading music quartets of the day. He continued to travel the country and perform. At age 54, however, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and unable to perform or travel anymore. But it was in this year that he wrote \"Victory in Jesus\", which of all the more than 800 songs he wrote in his lifetime has endured the most over the years. \n",
      " \n",
      "The lyrics become all the more poignant when you consider that Brumley would pass away less than two years later at only 56 years old. Even as his outer body was withering away, he could so powerfully feel Jesus' love, cry out to him to heal his spirit, and look forward to the crown of righteousness ready for all who have loved His appearing. \n",

      " \n",
      "Jim Hill as a young man studied to be a professional singer, even auditioning for the Metropolitan Opera, but thankfully for us and for the Kingdom of God he decided to dedicate his life to gospel music. In the 1940s, he started to both manage and sing tenor with the famed Golden Keys Quartet.\n",
      " \n",
      "In the early 1950's, he would write \"What a Day That Will Be\".The story goes that his mother-in-law got gravely ill. He was a new Christian at the time, and while he was driving home from work he asked God why this was happening to her. He then said that words just came flooding to his head--when he got home he grabbed a piece of cardboard and started writing the words down. The first person he sang the song to was his mother-in-law. \n",
      " \n",
      "The song was first presented by the Golden Keys Quartet and went on to be recorded by the Homeland Harmony Quartet. It would go on to become one of the most loved hymns in all of Southern Gospel music. Later in the 1960s, the Golden Keys Quartet would also help establish the songs of another young hymn writer by the name of Bill Gaither. \n",

      "Joseph Scriven was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1819. He grew up in Dublin and eventually attended Trinity College there. Tragedy struck him when he was a young man. He had been engaged to a beautiful young woman, but on the night before their wedding in 1845, she accidentally drowned. \n",
      " \n",
      "Grief stricken, Scriven emigrated to Ontario, Canada. There, he eventually fell in love and became engaged to another women, who herself suddenly fell ill of pneumonia and died shortly, again shortly before they were to be married. \n",
      " \n",
      "After this, he never married but devoted the rest of his life to helping others. He made it his goal to live according to the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. He soon earned a reputation as a man who willingly gave of himself to those in need, never turning down a request.\n",
      " \n",
      "The story goes that one day a man from his town saw him in his work clothes and wanted to hire him to chop some wood for him. \"He won't cut wood for you,\" said a man who knew Scriven. \"Why not?\" the man asked. \"Because you are able to pay for it. He only saws wood for poor widows and sick people.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "In 1855, Scriven heard that his mother was terribly ill. From thousands of miles away, Scriven wrote a poem to her called \"Pray Without Ceasing\". Scriven had intended the poem only to be read by his mother. But  over time it was passed around and found itself in a pamphlet of Sunday school hymns as the hymn \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Famous gospel singer, composer, and hymnal editor Ira D. Sankey stumbled upon it and published into his hymnal Gospel Hymns No. 1, where it immediately  had wide circulation.

      " \n",
      "It wasn't until 30 years later than Scriven was recognized as the true author of the piece. No one in Scriven's town of Port Hope had any idea that he had this kind of poetic ability. In the years right before his death, someone asked Scriven if he was really the author. His answer: \"The Lord and I did it between us\". \n",

      "When Isaac Watts was a young 22-year old man in his hometown Southampton, England, he wrote several hymns for his hometown church. He became a minister at the age of 25. Around this time, his brother Enoch wrote a letter to him urging him to publish his hymns. He wrote, \"there is great need of a pen, vigorous and lively as yours, to quicken and revive the dying devotion of the age.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Before  Watts' time most hymns were merely recitations of the Psalms and other poetry in the Bible. As still happens in many churches today, many church leaders felt more comfortable just sticking with the old, familiar ways of worship even if it meant that worship became dry and lifeless. \n",
      " \n",
      "On the other hand, Watts' hymns like Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed, O God Our Help in Ages Past, We're Marching to Zion, and Joy to the World were revolutionary in their day because they were filled with Biblical truths, but they could be sung with the fervor and emotion that should accompany true worship. \n",
      " \n",
      "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross was included in the first book of hymns that Watts published in 1707, with the original title \"Crucifixion to the World, by the Cross of Christ\". It also included the 4th verse above which we don't see very often today. The book was an instant and resounding success and to this day many call this hymn one of the finest in the history of the church in England. \n",

      "John Newton was a troubled kid who turned into a troubled young adult. His mother had died of tuberculosis when he was only six. His father worked on a boat and was never around, so he was raised by a stepmother who was distant to him and spent time in a boarding school where he was mistreated. At age 11, Newton joined his father as an apprentice on a ship. \n",
      " \n",
      "As he grew into adulthood, he became an insolent, headstrong man, ultimately renouncing the little faith that had been instilled in him by his mother. He joined the Royal Navy, only to desert, be captured, and be publicly flogged and demoted. After this he joined a slave ship and ended up continuing behavior that resulted in he himself being imprisoned, enslaved and forced to work on plantations like the slaves he was carrying. He was ultimately rescued by a sea captain who had known his father. \n",
      " \n",
      "Aboard his new ship, the Greyhound, Newton continued his ways, described by the captain of the ship as one of the most profane men he had ever met. But one day in March 1748 in the North Atlantic, the ship encountered a horrific storm. Newton witnessed one of his fellow crew members swept overboard by the waves to his death--from a place where Newton himself was standing just moments earlier. As water poured onto the ship, the crew began a desperate effort to empty water to keep the ship from capsizing. After hours of a losing battle of bailing water, with their captain's agreement, Newton and a shipmate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being swept overboard and continued to work for several more hours. At the point of his greatest desperation, he cried out, \"Lord, have mercy on us.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Two weeks later, the battered ship and what was left of the crew landed in Ireland. Weeks prior to the trip, Newton had been reading \"The Christian's Pattern\", sort of a Cliff's Note's version of The Imitation of Christ. He though back to the phrase he had cried out on the ship, and then thought about how he had not only renounced his faith, but also openly opposed it, mocked others of faith, and denounced God as a myth. \n",
      " \n",
      "On May 10, 1748, Newton accepted faith in Christ. Unlike some of the stories about his, he didn't give up the slave trade right away, but he did see to it that slaves under his care were treated humanely. He continued sailing for seven more years, during which time he educated himself. After he gave up sailing in 1755, he came to know religious leaders of the day such as George Whitefield and John Wesley. Newton eventually became an ordained minister. \n",
      " \n",
      "In 1767 the poet William Cowper settled in Newton's town of Olney, where the two became good friends. They held weekly church services and weekly prayer meetings, and composed hymns to be used during the weekly service, which eventually were compiled and published in an early hymnal called \"Olney Hymns\" in 1779, which contained 68 pieces by Cowper and 280 by Newton. \n",
      " \n",
      "The music that we associate with Amazing Grace actually wasn't added to the hymn until 1835, when William Walker tied the words to a traditional song called \"New Britain\". The pairing stuck and the hymn went on to become one of the most famous and well-loved in history. \n",
      " \n",
      "How is it that a profligate and profane young man who was only destined for misery, suffering, and sure death could have turn into a powerful minister for God who lived a long and contented life, who died with the hope of heaven in his heart, and who wrote such powerful words that still carry power today? It all comes down to two words: Amazing Grace. And if that Grace can touch a man like that, how much more can it transform your life. All you need to do is accept it. \n",

      " \n",
      "An English missionary names Stuart Hine heard the poem being sung and arranged the words and the music to become the familiar ones we hear today. Hines explained how he arrivved at each of the four verses while living in the Carpathian mountains of Russia. The first verse, he said, was writen when he was caught in a thunderstorm in a village. The second verse was written near the Romanian border, when he heard birds singing. The third verse was written when he saw many of the Carpathian villagers and mountain people coming to accept Christ. And the fourth was written once he was home in England. \n",
      " \n",
      "Again, the hymn didn't achieve widespread attention until Dr. J Edwin Orr (a reknowned Baptist minister who among other things penned the lyrics to \"Search Me, O God\") heard the hymn sung in India. He brought to back to the United States. It finally achieved widespread popularity when George Beverly Shea (famed singer and author of \"I'd Rather Have Jesus\") sung it at a Billy Graham crusade. \n",

      "C. Austin Miles lived from 1868 to 1946. He started life as a pharmacist, but wrote his first gospel song when he was 24 years old. His song was published by the Hall-Mack company. Miles gave up his life as a pharmacist and went on to serve as an editor and manager of Hall-Mack publishers for 37 years. He was quoted as saying, \"It is as a writer of gospel songs I am proud to be known, for in that way I may be of the most use of my Master, whom I serve willingly although not as efficiently as I desire.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Miles got his wish. Even  today, over 60 years after his death, some of his hymns have stood the test of time, from the beautiful \"Living in Beulah Land\" to the catchy \"A New Name in Glory\" to the ubiquitous children's song \"Wide, Wide as the Ocean.\" \"In the Garden\" is one of his most-loved hymns. According to Miles, the original inspiration for the hymn occurred when he read the passage in the gospels where Mary Magdalene encounters Jesus on the morning of the resurrection. Miles felt as if he were standing there witnessing the reunion between Mary and her Lord. Then he thought, \"This is not an experience limited to a happening almost 2000 years ago, but it is the daily companionship with the Savior that makes up the Christian's daily walk.\" \n",

      "Reverend Augustus Montague Toplady wrote the hymn \"Rock of Ages\" in 1763. It was published 12 years later in The Gospel Magazine in 1775. The story goes that the Reverend Toplady was walking along the gorge of Burrington Combe in England when he found himself in the middle of a huge thunderstorm. With rain lashing down, he ran into a nearby cave for shelter. While waiting for the storm to clear, he thought about how just as the rocks were providing him shelter from the storm, so to does Jesus, our rock, provide us shelter from the \"storms of life\" if we choose to hide ourselves in Him. \n",

      "The words of this hymn actually date back to 6th century Ireland. Originally it was not set to music at all, but was a monastic prayer called Rop tú mo baile, attributed to Dallan Forgaill. It wasn't until 1905 that Mary E. Byrne translated the lyrics from ancient Irish to English. The words were put in lyric form by Eleanor Hull in 1912. The hymn eventually was paired with the traditional Irish folk tune Slane in a 1927 hymnal. \n",

      "Sadly, we live in a generation today that seems all too willing to push God away. Technology has become a modern-day Tower of Babel. Who needs God when we have medical technology that can fix all kinds of diseases? Who needs God when there are so many ways to fill our lives, from reality TV shows, to social networks, to shopping, to going out drinking and having fun? \n",

      "But of course, these things just fill your life temporarily, leaving an even emptier hole afterwards. But this hymn is a good reminder of what a full life really is. Fulfillment doesn't come from becoming rich or famous. It only comes from understanding that a full life comes from remaining in Christ, because with him, you can bear all kinds of fruit, and apart from Him, you can do nothing. \n",

      "          In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire happened …one of the greatest disasters of their time, similar to how Hurricane Katrina, the Asian Tsunami, and the earthquake in Japan are disasters of our time. Many people lost all their possessions. Worse, Horatio Spafford’s son had died of scarlet fever at the age of 4 just prior to the Chicago Fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "          It was around that time that Mr. Spafford decided to make a new start, and to move his family overseas. He arranged to sell what was left of his property, and he bought tickets for himself, his wife, and his four daughters on a ship to take them to Europe. From there, they would move to Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "          Right before the ship was to set sail, Spafford found out that one of the sales of his property had fallen through. So he sent his wife and his daughters on ahead, while he went back to take care of the sale of his property. He would take the next ship and join them in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "          A few days later, Horatio Spafford received a telegram. It was signed by his wife. And there were only two words on it. “Saved alone”.\n",
      "\n",
      "          The ship that Horatio Spafford’s family was on was struck by another ship. It sank quickly. Spafford’s wife made it. But his four little girls did not. They lost their lives when the ship went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spafford soon sailed across the Atlantic to join his grieving wife in Europe. While he was halfway across the Atlantic, the captain called him to the bridge. He pointed out the exact location that his daughters lost their lives, as they sailed past it.It was then that Spafford wrote the words to a poem, which became this hymn. You can see a photo of the original manuscript by clicking on the image to the right. \n",
      "\n",
      "          Sometimes you make plans for your life, and the plans go up in flames. One minute you might be surrounded by your loved ones. The next moment you may be all alone. Sometimes things happen that in a million years you can never explain. It’s easy to say that you have faith in God when things are good. But when things are bad, can you say the same words that Spafford wrote here? \"Whatever my lot, it is well with my soul?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "          How could a man who lost his son, lost his business, and lost his four daughters possibly say that things were well with his soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "        People in the world look everywhere for peace. Banks and insurance companies say that having money, that’s what brings you peace and security. If you go to a store, you’ll see them sell aromatherapy candles and shampoo and soap that are supposed to bring peace to you. Some say that listening to light music can bring peace to you. Others say that seeing therapists will do the trick. Others rely on meditation and yoga. But this is all peace as the world gives.These things might bring some temporary relaxation, but they don’t bring peace to the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "          True peace only comes from one source:\n",
      "\n",
      "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "          In life, sometimes things can get chaotic. Sometimes you will feel alone, sometimes you will feel afraid. In this world we will have trouble. But the remarkable thing is, when you really know Christ you have the blessed assurance that you’re never really alone. And because of this you never need to be afraid. Because as chaotic as life gets, He has things under control. He will not leave you alone. He has already done all he can, by taking your sins away, not because we deserve it, but because of his love. And nothing can separate you from that love. \n",

      "Reverend Johnson Oatman, Jr. lived from 1856 to 1921. He joined the Methodist church at age 19. He was  licensed to preach and even ordained, but he ended up never pastoring a church. Instead, he became a businessman, busy first in a mercantile business and later in the insurance business. \n",
      " \n",
      "For many, the story would end there. But for Oatman, around the time he was 36 he started writing gospel songs. Between then and his death at age 65, he wrote an estimated 5,000 hymns in his \"free time\". That's about 4-5 new texts a week. His lyrics were in great demand by the leading gospel musicians of the day, and yet he never received more than $1.00 for any of his songs. Some of those songs include hymns that still continue to be sung and well loved today such as \"Count Your Blessings\" and \"No, Not One\". \n",
      " \n",
      "Sometimes, especially in today's world, it seems that we need to choose between serving God and having a career. There's even the misconception that the only ones who really \"serve God\" are the ones who give up their careers and devote themselves full-time to a ministry or a charity. While those are certainly high callings, I really appreciate the example that Johnson Oatman left. He proved that having a career and serving God doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. All you need to do is know the gifts that God has given you, be willing to use them, and pray that He lift you above the world to higher ground. Once this happens, there's no telling what good works He will use you for. \n",

      " \n",
      "Grief stricken, Scriven emigrated to Ontario, Canada. There, he eventually fell in love and became engaged to another women, who herself suddenly fell ill of pneumonia and died shortly, again shortly before they were to be married. \n",
      " \n",
      "After this, he never married but devoted the rest of his life to helping others. He made it his goal to live according to the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. He soon earned a reputation as a man who willingly gave of himself to those in need, never turning down a request.\n",
      " \n",
      "The story goes that one day a man from his town saw him in his work clothes and wanted to hire him to chop some wood for him. \"He won't cut wood for you,\" said a man who knew Scriven. \"Why not?\" the man asked. \"Because you are able to pay for it. He only saws wood for poor widows and sick people.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "In 1855, Scriven heard that his mother was terribly ill. From thousands of miles away, Scriven wrote a poem to her called \"Pray Without Ceasing\". Scriven had intended the poem only to be read by his mother. But  over time it was passed around and found itself in a pamphlet of Sunday school hymns as the hymn \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\". \n",

      "Famous gospel singer, composer, and hymnal editor Ira D. Sankey stumbled upon it and published into his hymnal Gospel Hymns No. 1, where it immediately  had wide circulation.

      " \n",
      "It wasn't until 30 years later than Scriven was recognized as the true author of the piece. No one in Scriven's town of Port Hope had any idea that he had this kind of poetic ability. In the years right before his death, someone asked Scriven if he was really the author. His answer: \"The Lord and I did it between us\". \n",

The story goes that once someone asked her, \"Isn't it terrible to be blind?\" to wihch she responded, \"Better to be blind and see with your heart than to have two good eyes and see nothing.\" \n",

It wasn't until age 41 when she met the famous composer William Bradbury that she started writing hymns. There is where she finally knew she'd found her calling in life, generating about three hymns a week for the rest of her life. She wrote that she was the \"happiest creature in all the land.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "As contemporaries often do to great artists, her work wasn't necessarily respected at the time. An English hymnologist John Julian once remarked that her hymns were \"with very few exceptions, very weak and poor\". All I can say to Mr. Julian is, 200 years later more people remember Fanny Crosby than remember John Julian. :) \n",

      "Blessed Assurance was a hymn where the tune preceded the lyrics. While visiting with her dear friend Phoebe Knapp, a musician who was a fellow resident of New York City and fellow member of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church, Knapp played the melody two or three times for Crosby and asked what she felt the tune said. Crosby answered in an instant: \"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\" \n",

      "Fanny Crosby passed on in 1915. At her request, a small gravestone was put there with the words \"Aunt Fanny: she hath done what she could; Fanny J. Crosby\". Forty years later, depsite her instructions, her friends put up a large memorial stone that contained the first stanze of Blessed Assurance. \n",

      "This is the line that jumps out at me when I sing this hymn. The words are by Sarah F. Adams, inspired by the words of Genesis 28. Sarah Adams was no stranger to suffering. Her mother died when she was 5 years old. Her dream was to be an actress, not because she wanted attention, but because she felt that could be a ministry to people. But her health prevented her from doing this, so she turned to writing. She wrote this hymn at the age of 36. She died seven years later of tuberculosis.\n",
      " \n",
      "The hymn itself has a storied history. In 1901, President McKinley, after being fatally shot, was reported to have said as his last words “‘Nearer, my God, to Thee, e’en though it be a cross’ has been my constant prayer”. In 1912, survivors of the Titanic recounted that this is what the ship’s band played as they knew they were dying.\n",
      " \n",
      "But when you sing the lyrics of the hymn, you’ll find that it’s not so much about dying, as it is about living. About new beginnings. About brushing the dust off and going on.\n",
      " \n",
      "The inspiration for this hymn was Genesis 28.\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob had just left home for the first time. He had just left his family. The brother he had grown up with now wanted to kill him. His mother told him to leave home because of that. His father’s health was ailing.\n",
      " \n",
      "So, he set out, not sure of what was in store for him. Years later, he would refer to these days as “the day of my distress”.\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.\n",
      " \n",
      "For all of his life, Jacob had been surrounded by his family, by servants, by animals, by good food, by a life filled with all his heart desired. Now, for the first time, he was alone, with nothing. He found a stone to use as a pillow and slept on the ground. One can only imagine how many tears this young man, suddenly so alone in the world, shed on that stone as he fell asleep.\n",
      " \n",
      "And that’s when God gave him His promise. “I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Jacob did something right. He woke up, and then he took the stone on which he was sleeping, and he built an altar. He made a vow. He vowed that if the Lord did all He said, then the Lord would be his God, and the stone he set up would be God’s house (Beth-El), and he would dedicate a tenth of all he was given to the Lord.\n",
      " \n",
      "Perhaps you're in a situation in life where you've lost all hope. Maybe you feel alone, and afraid, and unable to go on. If so, read these words again. But instead of reading the ones that God said to Jacob, read the ones that His Son says to you:\n",
      " \n",
      "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20).\n",
      " \n",
      "If you’ve encountered a tremendous loss, a loss beyond what words can express, nothing anyone says or does can bring what you’ve lost back. But where to go from here is your choice.\n",
      " \n",
      "You have two choices. You can continue to wallow in self-pity and regret. You can dwell on the past, trying whatever you can do to conjure back a past which is gone forever. Trust me, I know the temptation is great to do this.\n",
      " \n",
      "Or you can wake up, and remember what it is that the Lord told you. And from there, you can make a new beginning. You can take your stony griefs and raise your own Bethel, the house of God, in your heart.\n",
      " \n",
      "What does this mean? Well, there’s an interesting thing about enduring terrible loss. Prayer suddenly becomes a lot easier. Why? Because it’s only in the rough times that we realize that only God has the ability to understand us and help us. Like Joseph took that heavy stone on which he laid his head, take your griefs and lay them before God. Use them to build that altar--that marker in the ground which marks the first day of a new beginning.\n",
      " \n",
      "No matter what has happened in the past, no matter what mistakes you’ve made, or losses you’ve endured…there’s one thing you can do. Make a clean new start. Pray a prayer like Jacob did. Ask God to watch over you on the journey you are taking. Ask God to give you what you need to sustain you through the journey, wherever it takes you.\n",
      " \n",
      "Years later, Jacob returned to that same spot. Only this time, he returned married, children in tow, having been blessed immeasurably by God. It was here that he looked back and thought back to that day as a young man when he slept alone on this ground. He knew that God had indeed been with him wherever he had gone. And it was not long after that when Jacob was renamed Israel by God, and that he heard from God Himself how vast his descendants would be, and how from him nations and kings would come.\n",
      " \n",
      "Whatever state you’re in today, sing this hymn. Think of how despite the loss you’ve gone through, that out of your stony griefs, God is waiting to hear that prayer from you. That prayer that turns to him for help. That prayer that says that you wish nothing more than to be nearer to Him and to have Him be with you…from your own Bethel to the end of the age.\n",
